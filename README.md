# swe492
This project is a continuation and enhancement of the previously developed Learning Management System (LMS) dashboard from SWE491. The upgraded version introduces new functionalities aimed at improving user interactivity, feedback mechanisms, and system intelligence. Building on the existing core system—which includes a suggestion page, course enrollment, exam timetables, and messaging—the Phase II version brings two major additions: a Chatbot system and an User Activity Analysis Review page.

The chatbot feature is designed to provide real-time assistance to users navigating the LMS. It can respond to frequently asked questions related to exam schedules, registration issues, technical support, and other common student inquiries. This addition significantly enhances user experience and minimizes delays in resolving routine problems.

The User Activity Analysis Review page is another key enhancement in this phase. It provides both students and administrators with a clear visual summary of system engagement. Metrics such as login frequency, time spent on modules, number of suggestions submitted, and participation in voting or commenting are tracked and displayed to encourage more involvement and help faculty monitor class engagement.

The system continues to be developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. It is hosted using XAMPP, ensuring a local development environment that is easy to manage.

To execute the project, first ensure that required tools like PHP, MySQL, XAMPP, and optionally Node.js are installed. Download or clone the project files into your working directory. Set up the MySQL database using phpMyAdmin by importing the provided lms.sql file. Adjust the database connection settings in the backend configuration file to match your local setup. Start Apache and MySQL through the XAMPP control panel. Once the server is running, navigate to the project directory through your browser at http://localhost:8080/projectN/login.php If your chatbot or activity analysis page uses Node.js, you may need to run the backend using node app.js

This extended version maintains all existing functionalities from the original LMS dashboard and aims to create a more responsive and supportive academic platform for students and instructors alike.
